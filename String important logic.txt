Let's say there are two string str1 & suffix

To look for suffix in str1. Basically what we have to do here is,
think of suffix as the substring and look for it in the string - str1 from the end of it.

How we achieve that in cpp ? 

for(int i = suffix.length(); i >= 0; i--) {
  if(suffix[i] != str1[str1.length() - suffix.length()+i]);

  //* So here we're removing the suffix length from the original string and moving ahead ith 
  //* characters.
}
